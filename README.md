# HousingPricesMultipleRegression
This project is basically a linear regression project with multiple variables. I used a random data set supplied by Kaggle.com that had lots of data about housing including the price of houses, the area of the house, whether or not there is a basement in the house, whether the house has air conditioning or not etc. I used only the data that had a numerical value attached to it as this was what I intended to do. With this data I was able to create a program that predicts the housing price with user inputs.

-----Process-----
At first the data needs to be read in, I used the pandas library to read in the file into python. After that the data needs to be filtered to the columns that you want to use. The next step is to put that data into a matrix or array so operations can be done on the data. I used the numpy library to put the data in arrays as this would make it easier to manipulate the data. After the data is in the arrays the data needs to be split into data that will be used to train the model and data that will be used to test the model. The test data is going to be something that the model has never seen and is supposed to mimick how the model would woudl perform in real life.
